About
======

Hi! I'm Rodrigo, an Assistant Professor at the [Federal University of Uberlandia](http://www.ufu.br), Brazil, in the [School of Computer Science](http://www.facom.ufu.br). I'm a cybersecurity scientist and passionate about data science. My research is focused on developing innovative methods for attack prevention/detection, and analyzing cybersecurity data using quantification models.

My work and research
======

I use quantitative models, and computational methods to investigate the efficiency of current intrusion detection techniques, and also proposing new ones. Currently I'm interested in the following topics: i) evaluating the feasibility of using stream mining algorithms on building intrusion systems, ii) developing intrusion detection systems for IoT system, iii) investigating the impact of social platforms on detecting cybersecurity events, and iv) malware static analysis, in particular, evaluating ransomware families. 

My background and history
======

I received his B.S. degree in Mathematics from the Federal University of SÃ£o Carlos, Brazil, the M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees in Electrical Engineering from the University of Campinas, Brazil. In 2011, I was a visiting Ph.D. student under the supervision of Prof. Michel Cukier at the Cybersecurity Quantification Lab (CyQL), [University of Maryland, USA](https://www.umd.edu). Since 2013, I'm a professor at the School of Computer Science of the Federal University of Uberlandia and one of the coordinators of the [Security Management and Quantification Research Group (SEC-MQ)](http://www.uel.br/grupo-pesquisa/secmq/).
